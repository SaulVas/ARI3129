# Generative AI Journal

## 1. Introduction

Generative AI has become an indispensible tool across various fields, including research, engineering education, thanks to its ability to streamline workflows, enhance creativity, and automate respetitive tasks. For this project, CHatGPT (GPT-4o), developed by OpenAI, was selected to be the generative AI model to assist in the analysis and documentation of this computer vision assignment. The decision to use ChatGPT was influenced by its versatility in handling diverse tasks, ranging from generating some snippets of code and providing some debugging to explaining complex concepts in clear and concise language. Its ability to adapt to iterative feedback and refine outputs further reinforced its suitability for this project.

One of the key strengths of ChatGPT lies in its natural language understanding and generation capabilities. This allowed for seamless integration into various stages of the project, such as writing the background section, refining technical explanations and assisting with Python scripts for dataset analysis. Tasks such as counting counting classes, generating visualisations (e.g. Pie Charts) and analysing multiclass distributions were significantly accelerated by he AI’s ability to generate high-quality, functional code. Furthermore, ChatGPT provided valuable assistance in drafting documentation by creating structured and coherent narratives, which were later refined to meet the project’s specific requirements.

The rationale for choosing ChatGPT over other generative AI models, such as Claude or Gemini, was primarily driven by its accessibility, extensive community support, and robust integration with tools like Jupyter Notebook and VS Code. ChatGPT’s capacity to handle iterative prompts and deliver detailed responses tailored to specific needs was instrumental in overcoming technical challenges. For example, during the dataset analysis phase, ChatGPT helped troubleshoot issues related to class imbalances and missing labels, providing both solutions and context for the encountered problems.

Moreover, ChatGPT proved to be an invaluable brainstorming partner, helping to generate ideas and approaches for tasks such as organising dataset preparation workflows and structuring the project’s technical paper. Its real-time collaboration capabilities streamlined the process of integrating technical and analytical elements into a coherent project narrative.

The use of generative AI was not without its considerations. While ChatGPT excelled in many areas, the decision to rely on it also required a critical understanding of its limitations, particularly in the areas of originality and context-specific precision. Nonetheless, its integration into the project enabled substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality, making it an indispensable tool for this research. In the subsequent sections, this journal explores the ethical considerations, methodologies, and specific contributions of generative AI to the project, along with reflections on its overall impact.

## 2. Ethical Considerations

The integration of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, into this project raised some ethical considerations, particularly in the areas of data bias, originality and fairness. While ChatGPT proved to be an invaluable tool in generating code, analysing data, and drafting documentation, its application required ongoing critical evaluation to ensure ethical standards were upheld. These considerations underscore the importance of responsible AI usage in academic and technical work.
